        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Taiwan, ShaoChen Yang never envisioned himself
          running a poke restaurant in Helsinki. Food, however, had always been
          a part of his life: his first job was as a barista, where he managed
          small cafes around the city, and his earliest memories are of cooking
          with his grandmother, where he learned how to make traditional
          Taiwanese recipes such as Lu Rou Fan.
        </p>

        <p>
          When ShaoChen moved to Finland in his twenties to study, he fell in
          love with the country’s clean ingredients and appreciation for simple,
          honest food. From this, the idea for Eat Poke was thus born.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as a small counter inside a market hall has now grown into
          a recognizable Helsinki brand. Eat Poke has now just opened their 10th
          chain in Helsinki, making it one of Helsinki’s biggest Poke chains.

        <h2>Interview</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q1: What’s your story before starting Eat Poke, and what made you
            want to become an entrepreneur?
          </h3>
          <p>
            ShaoChen told me that the journey toward entrepreneurship wasn’t so
            much a single decision as it was a realization.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I always loved food, but I never imagined opening a restaurant,” he
            said. “What actually pushed me to build my own restaurant was my
            culture, and the kind of food I missed.” A sentiment that rings true
            for many internationals that have relocated away from home. Eat Poke
            became that outlet, a space where he could merge Asian flavours from
            home with the high-quality Finnish produce.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q2: What was the initial idea for your business?</h3>
          <p>
            “When I moved here, healthy food often meant salads: lettuce, a few
            toppings, and that was it,” ShaoChen explained. “I’m Asian, so a lot
            of our meals come with some kind of protein. That’s where the idea
            for Poke came in.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The original idea behind Eat Poke was simply to bring a fresh,
            healthy and customizable experience to Helsinki. One that would
            provide a different experience to the salad bars that are so
            commonly found around the world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q3: Has your business idea changed over time? What is the current
            business model or mission?
          </h3>
          <p>
            “Honestly, the menu changed, but our priorities didn’t,” ShaoChen
            said.
          </p>
          <p>
            He explained that Eat Poke grew organically. New toppings, new
            proteins, new sauces, many were inspired by Finnish customers’
            curiosity or by ingredients he found while experimenting after
            hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But we have always strived to provide fresh food, tasty flavours
            and to treat our customers kindly.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike most restaurants, Eat Poke didn’t rely heavily on marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Some customers have been with us since day one,” he noted. “They
            bring their families, they bring their coworkers. It means
            everything.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q4: What was the hardest part of starting your business?</h3>
          <p>“Everything except the cooking,” ShaoChen remarked.</p>
          <p>
            He elaborated that rent, budgeting, and supply chain logistics were
            far more complicated and bothersome than his passion, developing
            recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Cooking for me is fun. Filling out paperwork in a language that
            isn’t yours... that’s a different challenge.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But for him, the toughest part wasn’t just the technical aspects of
            running a business, it was also the emotional difficulty.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There were moments where I felt very alone,” he shared. “When the
            fridge breaks at midnight, or when a supplier cancels, you realize:
            this is all on you.”
          </p>
          <p>Still, he believes those challenges shaped him.</p>
          <p>
            “I learned how to be resourceful, and I learned patience. You need
            to have a sort of ‘I’m going to figure it out’ mindset.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q5: How did you make Eat Poke stand out?</h3>
          <p>“I got lucky,” ShaoChen laughed.</p>
          <p>
            He added that while he believes that Eat Poke provides quality food,
            fresh produce and great customer service, ShaoChen admits that his
            success is mostly due to his customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We didn’t have a social media team at the start, and so a lot of
            our initial growth was based on word of mouth. Looking back, we were
            very lucky to have grown as we have.”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, ShaoChen added that it wasn’t all pure luck. “People can
            taste when you care. Our sauces are homemade. Our toppings are
            prepared fresh every morning. We don’t freeze any of our food.”
            ShaoChen believes that it was this attention to detail that made Eat
            Poke stand out.
          </p>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q6: What are the most important lessons you've learned from starting
            your own business?
          </h3>
          <p>
            “The biggest lesson is to stay true to your purpose,” ShaoChen said.
          </p>
          <p>
            He explained that, as Eat Poke grew, people encouraged him to expand
            aggressively, franchise, or compromise quality to reduce costs. But
            he refused.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I wanted to make sure that I focused on maintaining standards
            before I expanded too quickly.” He stated, explaining that he wanted
            to ensure that they could maintain their quality before expanding.
            “That and it was too much work,” he said while laughing.
          </p>
          <p>Another key lesson was humility.</p>
          <p>
            “As an entrepreneur, you do every job,” he said. “You clean the
            tables, slice the fish, and take out the garbage. You can’t think
            anything is ‘below you.’” However, ShaoChen also stressed that this
            was a vital part of expanding. By taking on every role in the
            company, he learned how much time goes into each role, which allowed
            him to better estimate how many workers he needed to assign to each
            ‘job’.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, ShaoChen emphasized perseverance.</p>
          <p>
            “There will always be setbacks,” he said. “But if you believe in the
            vision, and you’re willing to work hard, things will move forward.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q7: If you could give yourself one piece of advice at the beginning
            of this journey, what would it be?
          </h3>
          <p>
            “Focus on making your customer happy, and everything else follows.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ShaoChen explained that in the early days, Eat Poke never had a
            social media team. Instead, they relied on organic word of mouth to
            attract more customers.He explained that, in the early days, he
            doubted whether people would accept his food, whether his accent
            would be a barrier, or whether a small idea could survive in a
            competitive market.
          </p>
          <p>
            But ShaoChen believes that his attention to detail and focus on
            customer experience were what ultimately set Eat Poke apart. As he
            put it, “make a business with care.”

      <section class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          Interviewing ShaoChen reminded me that there isn’t necessarily a
          single formula to entrepreneurship. One’s path is shaped by culture,
          personal history, and the values a founder chooses to honor. ShaoChen
          never chased rapid scaling, flashy marketing, or aggressive expansion
          for its own sake. His and Eat Poke’s success came from consistency:
          staying true to his roots, never compromising on quality, and
          prioritizing customer satisfaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stood out to me the most was how Eat Poke grew through
          authenticity rather than strategy. There were no big advertising
          campaigns, no venture-backed plans, just a focus on good food and
          customer service. Customers didn’t just buy bowls; they returned
          because they felt the care put into each one.
        </p>

        <p>
          ShaoChen’s journey also reflects the dual nature of entrepreneurship.
          The practical side: rent, accounting, logistics, long nights fixing
          broken equipment. These are all unforeseen demands of the job that
          require discipline and resilience. But the emotional side is just as
          demanding: believing in your idea when no one else does, learning from
          mistakes, and persevering through moments of doubt.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, Eat Poke’s success is not just about poke bowls; it’s
          about a founder who pursued his passion, always put customers first,
          and most importantly, never gave up. While some might call it luck,
          Eat Poke’s journey has taught me that luck can be created through hard
          work and relentless perseverance.
